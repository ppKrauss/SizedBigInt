## Javascript source-code

There are two main ways to reuse the SizedBigInt class:
* Browsers: as usual class, usual load script. Avoid "expor class" with browsers.
* NodeJs: as usual class or, optional, "export default class". In this  case uncomment the "export default" line. Remember that class is yeat an experimental feature, so, use for example `node --experimental-modules examples/demo01.mjs opt1`

## Using examples

All examples are for terminal use, check header lines of each script to use-explanation.
